[**Bug reports | Support | Issues | Discussions about OM#**](https://github.com/cac-t-u-s/om-sharp-users/issues)

Please just use the [Issues](https://github.com/cac-t-u-s/om-sharp-users/issues) link of this repository to report a bug, open a discussion, ask questions about OM#.     
Some of them will become issues in the main OM# project :)

## Workflow / instructions:

- Please try to make the title of the issue as clear and specific as possible
- Describe your problem clearly / provide reproductible examples when relevant
- Do not hestitate to use labels to differentiate bug reports, suggestions/missing feature, questions, ...
- Specify your operating system and OM# version -- make sure to try the latest OM# version before to report bugs

When an issue is transferred to the OM# development repository, a mention will appear in the conversation: your problem is being fixed, and you can track progress from there. When an issue is solved or finished, it will receive the label "solved" (or "wontfix", if it won't be fixed!)
